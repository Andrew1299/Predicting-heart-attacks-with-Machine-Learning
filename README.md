# Predicting-heart-attacks-with-Machine-Learning
ITP 449 Final project
This is a collection of ML models I constructed for my final project for ITP 449. Using the heart attack dataset provided, I constructed a logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random forest, Boosting, and Voting classifiers to predict likely heart attack victims.
